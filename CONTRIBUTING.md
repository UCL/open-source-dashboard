Thanks for your interest in our dashboard!
It is a fork from [GitHub community projects][upstream].

If you want to contribute some UCL-specific suggestions to _this_ UCL dashboard you're very welcome!
Please [open an issue] or submit a pull request to this repository.

If you've got ideas for general improvements, that's great!
But it might be better to [suggest them upstream](https://github.com/github-community-projects/org-metrics-dashboard/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Contributions to this project - both here and upstream - are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](LICENSE.md).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Configure and install the dependencies: `npm i`
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `npm t`
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the style by fixing any ESLint errors.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).
