## The UCL Open Source Metrics Dashboard

This dashboard is a snapshot of data about open source software from some of UCL's GitHub organisations.
All the metrics are based on the _Last Updated Date_ reflected on the top of the dashboard.
It is maintained by the [Open Source Team](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/open-source) in the [Centre for Advanced Research Computing](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc).

### Definitions

**Contributors:** A contributor is an individual that has added some code to the current repository. This metric calculates the current number of contributors.

**Watchers:** The number of users who are tracking a particular repository, receiving notifications regarding its activity.

**Open Issues:** Issues are tickets that represent bugs or new features that other people report and can collaborate on. Open issues are total of unresolved issues.

**Open PR's:** A pull request is a request to make a change to the files of the project (code, documentation, README changes, etc.). Open PR's are the total of pull requests with status Open.

**Merge PR's**: A total of Pull Requests that are accepted into the code base of the project.

**Total Fork:** A fork is a copy of the current repository belonging to another user. Total Forks is how many times the repository has been copied.

**Open Issues Median Age:** Median number of days for all issues with Open status. If the issue age is zero (meaning there are no open issues), we display "N/A".

**Close Issues Median Age:** Median number of days for all issues with Closed status. If the issue age is zero (meaning there are no open issues), we display "N/A".

**Issue Response Median Age:** Median response time of issues that has a response. If the issue response age is zero (meaning there are no comments), we display "N/A". If the first response is by the creator of the issue the comment is not counted.

**Issue Response Average Age:** Average response time of issues that has a response. If the issue response age is zero (meaning there are no comments), we display "N/A". If the first response is by the creator of the issue the comment is not counted. Calculation is Issues Total Response Time divide by Total Issues
