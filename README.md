# Open Source Metrics Dashboard

This dashboard shows an overview of UCL's open source repository health. 
It is a fork from [GitHub community projects](https://github-community-projects.github.io/org-metrics-dashboard) that has been fixed up by our colleagues over in the [@neuroinformatics-unit](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit).
